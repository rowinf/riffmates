HTTP server that implements the Python WSGI protocol (PEP 333, rev 1.21).

Based on wsgiref.simple_server which is part of the standard library since 2.5.

This is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Django apps. It hasn't

    This function, and the ``WSGI_APPLICATION`` setting itself, are only useful

    be configured to point to the correct application object directly.
